## Functional Requirements

| # | User Story Title | User Type | User Story Description | Story Specifications | Priority |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Index page | All users | Welcome page for an anonymous user | When a user that is not logged in enters the website, a welcome screen appears. It contains sign in and sign up buttons and it presents some features of the application, using parallax scrolling effect. | High |
| 2 | Sign up | All users except admin | User needs to sign up to create/ participate in a project | Create a form that contains the following required fields: mail, first name, last name and password. User is redirected automatically to user homepage (see #11). | High |
| 3 | Sign in | All users | User needs to sign in to create/ participate in a project | Create a form that contains the following fields: email, password and the button "Log in". After sign in, user is redirected automatically to user homepage (see #11). | High |
| 4 | Forgot Password | All users except admin | User can get a new password | In sign in form, there is a button "Forgot Password" that redirects user to a page that contains a field to add his/her email and a button "Send". This procedure emails user a link to set a new password. | Medium |
| 5 | Sign out | All users | User needs to exit the application | The navigation bar has a user settings drop down menu in the right corner. It gives the option to sign out and redirects user to index page (see #1). | High |
| 6 | Profile | All users except admin | User has public profile with contact info and profile picture | User can access his profile via user settings drop down menu. In profile are shown: profile picture, first name, last name and mail. Description, country, job company and bio are also displayed, if given. (optionally: number of projects user participates, and current work). | High |
| 7 | Edit Profile | All users except admin | User can update his/her personal info | In profile page there is a button "Edit Profile" only visible to the logged in user, who can edit all information above, plus password. | High |

| 10 | User homepage | All users except admin | User can have any role in many projects and is able to select one of them | Show a grid (see bootstrap) with all projects that user participates. By choosing one, user is redirected to the corresponding project page (see #10). | High |
| 11 | Invite members to project | Product owner/ Customer | Product owner/ Customer can add members in the selected project | In the project page, there is a unit "Members" that displays all members of the project and their roles. At the end of this list, there is an input box. Product owner is able to add new members in project by typing their mail and clicking "invite". | High |
| 12 | Assign roles to team members | Product owner/ Customer | Product owner/ Customer of the current project will determine the role of each member | When adding a new member, product owner has the option to select user role, by a dropdown menu next to the input box.

| 13 | Accept invitation to project | All users except admin | User is notified when a pending invitation occurs and he accepts it or declines it | Left to the user settings drop down menu, there is a notification drop down button. A badge (see bootstrap) appears on it when a new notification occurs. It lists the pending project invitations, that consist of the project name and the assigned role. When a user selects an invitation, he/she is redirected to the corresponding project page. On the top of that page, two buttons exist: accept and decline invitation to be a member of this project. If user accepts it, he/she remains to the project page, else he/she is redirected to user homepage (see #11). | High |
| 14 | Update product backlog | Product owner/ Customer | Product owner can create a backlog | On project page there is a button to update the product backlog. The product backlog is a kanban board of PBI items with the following attributes: title, description, priority and type (Epic or User Story). An epic may contain several user stories. Also, user can add a story to an epic by drag and drop or create a new story inside an epic. | High |

Arrays have the following fields: (Order, Completed Task or Remaining Task Title and the Title of the epic that is related with it.) | High |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| # | Category | Title | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Security | Password Requirements | The length should be between 8 and 16 characters. Password must contain at least one upper case alphabetic character, one lower case alphabetic character, one special character, and one numeric character. |
| 2 | Security | Password Encryption | Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt function and a secure random salt before saving them to the database. This operation should be performed on the server side to prevent Dictionary and Brute Force Attack. |
| 3 | Security | SSL Encryption | Use SSL encryption to send sensitive data through the network like credit card numbers. Also, use an SSL certificate to make our customers trust us as a company. |
| 4 | Security | Prevent SQL Injections | Validate user input data and shield the application from SQL injections. This can be achieved by filtering the input data before storing them to database to ensure that the system is safe from this kind of attacks. |
| 5 | Security | Authentication | Identify an end-user in the system and validate that the user is telling the truth. Use Json Web Token (JWT) for this feature. |
| 6 | Security | Authorization | Authorization is controlled access to information in the application once a user is identified and authenticated. Also, partition users into anonymous and authenticated and give them the right permissions to modify or access data. |
| 7 | Usability | Usability Heuristics | User interface design must conform to Nielsen's usability heuristics. The user interface should be tested early in the design process to avoid common mistakes. |
| 8 | Usability | Consistency and System Standards | The user interface must be consistent.  1. The layout should be the same across the application.  2. The navigation bar must be in the same place. 3. Use the same wording and visualization for the same functions. |
| 9 | Usability | Error Prevention | The user should be warned on the following situations: 1. When he/she is about to delete something. (e.g. A task from the todo list on the sprint page.) 2. The primary action should be emphasized. (e.g. Submit button in a form) 3. When he/she completes a form. (e.g. Warn him/her if the password does not match the requirements before submit) |
| 10 | Usability | Minimalistic Design | The user interface should follow minimalistic design: 1. The interface should be easy to get used to. 2. Lots of text should be avoided. |
| 11 | Maintainability | Modularity | The code should be build in modules, so that independent parts accomplish independent tasks. This could be accomplished through the use of functions, interfaces and classes. |
| 12 | Maintainability | Design Patterns | Use of design patterns to solve common code modelling problems. (e.g. MVC pattern on back end and front end.) |
| 13 | Maintainability | High Cohesion - Low Coupling | - High cohesion means that we should bind the related code together as close as possible. - The low coupling means that we should organize our code through interfaces and make our classes be as independent as possible. |
| 14 | Maintainability | Layered Application Design | Application would consist of different layers like Presentation Layer, Bussiness Layer and Data Layer (3-Tier). |
| 15 | Scalability | Compress Files | Minimize the number of static assets, such as images, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), required by the application. Use always minified (.min.js) files for javascript files. |
| 16 | Scalability | AJAX Calls | Use AJAX-based asynchronous models for server invocations for partial page refresh. |
| 17 | Mobility | Operational System in different Devices and Platforms | The system should be operational in a wide range of devices and platforms, such as different screen sizes (Responsive) and web browsers. |
| 18 | Extensibility | Follow RESTful Architecture | Make a RESTful API which could be used in a future extension of our platform to a mobile application (Android, ios) without many changes. |
| 19 | Extensibility | Documentation (UML diagrams, navigation flow) | Present a general approach of the structure of the web application using UML diagrams. A new team member will possibly be informed of the current project state. |
| 20 | Deployment | Deploy on a remote server | The application will be independent of the development environment. It will be instantly deployed in any remote server that runs tomcat. |
